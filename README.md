This is our shared collection of useful resources and code snippets for Data Science. We will work on adding the resources from the Brightspace Site here over time.

In addition to the resources that we add, we invite you to add your own resources, code snippets, fun things, etc. to this repository. The goal is that you can use this long after you are done with the class.
